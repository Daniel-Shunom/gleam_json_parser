### glindo is a functional parser combinator library designed for composing parsers for context free grammer such as JSON, CSV, small DSL, YAML, e.t.c. As expected with gleam, it is built using functional paradigms and monadic types for encapsulating and simulating state. More information will be released in the following weeks!

```sh
gleam add glindo
```
```gleam
import glindo

pub fn main() {
  // TODO: An example of the project in use
}
```

Further documentation can be found at [Coming Soon].

## Development

### glindo is still in development. Be on the lookout for a stable release in the coming weeks!

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
```
